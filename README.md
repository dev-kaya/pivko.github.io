Pivko s Klukama z Matfyzu – Event Page

This is a simple, static HTML page for the annual Pivko s Klukama z Matfyzu event – the biggest unofficial tech & startup meetup for Czech and Slovak students in Prague.
It’s designed to be minimal, nerdy, and easy to deploy on GitHub Pages, Webflow custom code, or any static hosting.

If you want, I can also prepare a tiny ASCII logo banner for the README to make it more “nerdy” in style. Would you like me to do that?
